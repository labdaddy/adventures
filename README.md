# adventures
This website project will show a curated list of our trips together and all the fun we've had. We will have a lot of cool features like:
1. A large main map that shows all of the places we have visited so far.
2. Interactive trip specific maps that show our itineraries, sites visited and commentary, restaurants, reviews and recommendations. 
3. Dark mode for those who prefer it
Animated flags of the countries/ states visited
